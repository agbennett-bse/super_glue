## Project Description
In this project, we selected the SuperGLUE LLM benchmark dataset for our project. Specifically, we chose the BoolQ dataset which consists of a yes or no question, and a passage that contains information about the question. The label is the answer to the question either yes or no. We created rules models to understand the structure of the data, then implemented multiple training methods on our BERT model to gain understanding of how our model was performing on different training subsets. We implemented a final RNN model, and tested State of the Art machine learning models like DeBERTA on the benchmark dataset. Finally we distilled our best performing model.
